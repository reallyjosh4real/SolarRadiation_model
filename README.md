Diagnosing Solar Hot Spots in Denver Metro Area

## Table of Context 
### Introduction
<p>Climate change is an ever present topic in the news today. Australia is literally on fire right now. The strive for global sustainability is of the utmost imprtance in todays current climate. That is why I decided to see if it was possible to help Denver take steps toward that sustainable future.</p>

### Question

<li>Are there areas in Denver that recieve larger anounts of solar radiation as others?</li>
<li>Where in Denver does that happen?</li>
<li>Where would be the most cost effective place to set up a solar farm?</li>

### Data 
<p>The data I used for this EDA was provided by NREL(National Renewable Energy Laboritory). The data consisted of measured and expected values of solar radiation devided into three different types of measured solar radiation(DHI,DNI,GHI). Direct Normal Irradiance(DNI) is the unit of measurement that I was most interested in because it has the highest values yielded of solar energy. </p>
